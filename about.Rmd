# About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Biostatistics and Health Data Science program at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis, MN. I work in spatiotemporal modeling for neuroimaging research with Dr. Mark Fiecas. I also collaborate with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in multimodal data integration. I'm passionate about statistical collaboration in medical research, and open to summer internships in biostatistics or a related field.

## Outside of Academia

When I am not studying or working on research, I love to cook, eat, and take pictures of food. You can find out more on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/will.cooks.and.eats/)!
